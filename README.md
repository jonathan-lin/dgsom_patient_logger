Patient logging script

This script automates the patient encounter logging process on Gryphon. 

The script requires python, selenium, xlrd and a webdriver (I use geckodriver but chromedriver should work as well)

Enter your data into an excel spreadsheet following the sample spreadsheet

When you initiate the script, there will be a 30 second pause for you to log into gryphon.
